	<p class="mt-2">
		After registration, you will be asked 5 questions by a chatbot. Your answers must be 300 words
		or less. The chatbot will compare your answer with the answer provided by your Professor. The
		chatbot does not judge you, it simply shares how you could improve your answer if asked a
		similar query on a future exam. None of your answers are recorded. No grade is assigned. Your
		Professor will not be informed of your individual success rate. Your Professor only receives
		macro KPIs related to overall class’s success (Eg. Average score of all students in the last 24
		hours, 7 days, 30 days, number of sessions completed, % of students using r the chatbot etc.).
		You must use your university email to login. Best practices strongly encourage you to only use a
		randomly generated password and not to use the same password you employ for other university
		accounts. Other than your account email, account password, usage and session history NO other
		user data is recorded nor stored by ProfBot on our (and) openAI servers. For details please see:
		openAI.com/faq We remind users that this is a 100% optional service and they are free to logout
		at any time or not use it all. But by using this service you grant us your informed consent.
		Your consent is revocable by you AT ANY time. Simply email: unsub@profbot.ai”.
