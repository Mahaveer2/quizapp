		ProfBot is a conversational digital tutor that quizzes students 1 on 1 on course material, on
		any device, at anytime of the day, providing students with individualized feedback on how to
		improve. Simply email your practice test to <a href="mailto:submit.test@profbot.ai">submit.test@profbot.ai</a> and 24 hours later you will
		be emailed the URL for your class chatbot. You then simply give your URL to your students and
		the learning begins. Each session focuses 5 questions from your list. There is no cost for
		instructors (nor schools) to use ProfBot. Each week, each student gets one FREE Profbot session
		in which to review course material. Additional sessions cost the student $1. Have another
		course? Just email in another list of questions and answers and get another ProfBot for use.
